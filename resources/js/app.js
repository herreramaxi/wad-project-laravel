//bootstrap-maxlength
$("input[maxlength], textarea").maxlength({
    alwaysShow: true, //if true the threshold will be ignored and the remaining length indication will be always showing up while typing or on focus on the input. Default: false.
    // threshold: 10, //Ignored if alwaysShow is true. This is a number indicating how many chars are left to start displaying the indications. Default: 10
    warningClass: "form-text text-muted mt-1", //it's the class of the element with the indicator. By default is the bootstrap "badge badge-success" but can be changed to anything you'd like.
    limitReachedClass: "form-text text-muted mt-1", //it's the class the element gets when the limit is reached. Default is "badge badge-danger". Replace with text-danger if you want it to be red.
    //separator: ' of ', //represents the separator between the number of typed chars and total number of available chars. Default is "/".
    //preText: 'You have ', //is a string of text that can be outputted in front of the indicator. preText is empty by default.
    //postText: ' chars remaining.', //is a string outputted after the indicator. postText is empty by default.
    //showMaxLength: true, //showMaxLength: if false, will display just the number of typed characters, e.g. will not display the max length. Default: true.
    //showCharsTyped: true, //if false, will display just the remaining length, e.g. will display remaining lenght instead of number of typed characters. Default: true.
    placement: "bottom-right-inside" //is a string, object, or function, to define where to output the counter. Possible string values are: bottom ( default option ), left, top, right, bottom-right, top-right, top-left, bottom-left and centered-right. Are also available : **bottom-right-inside** (like in Google's material design, **top-right-inside**, **top-left-inside** and **bottom-left-inside**. stom placements can be passed as an object, with keys top, right, bottom, left, and position. These are passed to $.fn.css. A custom function may also be passed. This method is invoked with the {$element} Current Input, the {$element} MaxLength Indicator, and the Current Input's Position {bottom height left right top width}.

    //appendToParent: true, // appends the maxlength indicator badge to the parent of the input rather than to the body.
    //message: an alternative way to provide the message text, i.e. 'You have typed %charsTyped% chars, %charsRemaining% of %charsTotal% remaining'. %charsTyped%, %charsRemaining% and %charsTotal% will be replaced by the actual values. This overrides the options separator, preText, postText and showMaxLength. Alternatively you may supply a function that the current text and max length and returns the string to be displayed. For example, function(currentText, maxLength) { return '' + Math.ceil(currentText.length / 160) + ' SMS Message(s)';}
    //utf8: if true the input will count using utf8 bytesize/encoding. For example: the 'Â£' character is counted as two characters.
    //showOnReady: shows the badge as soon as it is added to the page, similar to alwaysShow
    //twoCharLinebreak: count linebreak as 2 characters to match IE/Chrome textarea validation
    //customMaxAttribute: String -- allows a custom attribute to display indicator without triggering native maxlength behaviour. Ignored if value greater than a native maxlength attribute. 'overmax' class gets added when exceeded to allow user to implement form validation.
    //allowOverMax: Will allow the input to be over the customMaxLength. Useful in soft max situations.
